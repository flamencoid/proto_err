To run tests run:

nosetests

from the top directory. 

To read in a reference file subsample and realign with random read errors 
and output a samfile
python subsample.py -r referenceFile.fa
or simply,
./subsample.py to run with default reference

Run subsample.py -h for additional options

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REFFILENAME, --ref=REFFILENAME
                        fasta input ref file
  --numReads=NUMREADS   Number of reads to
                        sample from referecnce (Optional defaults to 1000)
  --meanReadLength=READMEAN
                        Read length is
                        sampled from a normal of this mean (Optional defaults
                        to
                        1000)
  --errorFreqMean=SNPFREQ
                        Probablity of an error
                        at a base occurs is sampled from a normal with mean
                        of this Probablity (Optional defaults to
                        .1)
  --errorFreqSD=SNPFREQSD
                        Probablity of an error
                        at a base occurs is sampled from a normal with SD
                        of this value (Optional defaults to
                        errorFreqMean/10)
  --strandBias=STRANDBIAS
                        Ratio of reads
                        sampled from forward or reverse strand. 1 samples only
                        from                                          forward,
                        0 only from reverse.(Optional defaults to .5)
  --ReadLengthSD=READSD
                        Read length is
                        sampled from a normal with this SD (Optional defaults
                        to
                        meanReadLength/3)
  --SnpIndelRatio=SNPINDELRATIO
                        Ratio of SNP
                        errors to INDEL errors (Optional defaults to 0.5)
                        value of 1 gives ONLY SNP errors, 0 only INDELs
  --meanIndelSize=INDELMEAN
                        INDEL size is
                        sampled from a normal of this mean (Optional defaults
                        to                                                  5)
  --IndelSizeSD=INDELSD
                        INDEL size is
                        sampled from a normal with this SD (Optional defaults
                        to
                        meanIndelSize/2)


*Error Reading*


python errorStats.py -r referenceFile.fa -s samfile.sam

**Usage beyond scripts**

To iterate through errors in samfile

from metrics import errorReader
for error in errorReader:
	print error

The error class has the following attributes amoungst others

error.before(i) will return the i bases before the error. It will return exactly
i letters returning N when a base does not exist.

i.e. if the error occurs at the first base in a read .before(2) will return 'NN'

simillarly error.after(i) will return the i bases after the error has ended.

error.isSnp
error.isIndel
